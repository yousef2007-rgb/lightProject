            <h1>What Happens When Light strikes objects?</h1>
            <p>When light strikes an object, the light can be reflected, or bounced off the object. The light might also be absorbed, or taken in by the object.
            Or the light can be transmitted, or passed through the object. Objects that you cannot see through, such as wood and metal, are called opaque. When light strikes an opaque object, the light is either reflected or absorbed. You cannot see through an opaque object because light cannot pass through it. A glass object is transparent. When light strikes it, the light is allowed to pass through. As a result, you can see through the glass object.
            Other objects are translucent. When light strikes them, only some light passes through. When you look through a translucent object, you can see something behind it, but you cannot see the details clearly.
